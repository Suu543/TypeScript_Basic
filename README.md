# TypeScript_Basic
Su's Road to Study TypeScript


### TypeScript = Javascript + A type-system

<br>
<br>

### The TypeScript(TS) Type System
- Helps us catch errors during development
- Uses "type annotations" to analyze our code
- Only <b>active</b> during development
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization

<br>
<br>

```
Typescript Code (Javascript with type annotations)
                   |
                   |
                   v
          TypeScript Compiler
                   |
                   |  
                   v
          Plain old JavaScript
                   |
                   |
                   V
Browser executes plain Javascript, has no idea we wrote Typescript
```

### Summary
- Writing Typescript is the same as writing Javascript with some <b>"extra documentation"</b>
- Typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or Node.
- It is best to think of Typescript as being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding.
