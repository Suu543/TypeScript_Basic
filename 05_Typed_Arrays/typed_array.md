# Typed Arrays

- Arrays where each element is some <b>consistent</b> type of value

## Why do we care?

- TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array
- TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array
- We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions
- Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

## When to use typed arrays?

- Any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order
