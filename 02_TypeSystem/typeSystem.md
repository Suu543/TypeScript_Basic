# The study flow of typeSystem

- Plain Definition
- Why do we care?
- Examples
- When to use this?

# Definition

<b>Type</b>: Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

ex)
<b>"red"</b>

- Definition: It's a string
- TypeScript Definition: It is a value that has all properties + methods that we assume that a string has, such as indexOf(), concat(), includes(), etc...
